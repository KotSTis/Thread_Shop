In this meeting, we started using trello, which helped us with the Agile, since we could show to each other
which instance variables, methods and parameters are used for each class.
Alex started designing the new GUI, Jiaxi started to implement the Log Class, and Georgios finished with the old GUI, 
and tried to start implementing the Staff Class.
