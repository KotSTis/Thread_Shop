In this meeting, we made use of agile techniques.
We started pair programming, since it's more useful by interacting with each other live.
Then, we tried to start stand-up, since this would help us bring more attention to the one talking.
After we did this, Jiaxi created the new csv files and applied new changes that were needed for CsvReader and Order class.
Then, we decided which threads we should use for all classes, and which classes whould be for MVC and Singleton.
We decided that the log class should be used as Singleton, and then, the Queue and the Staff class would be used as Model,
new GUI as Viewer and AllOrders class as Controller that would handle all the orders.
